# odin-recipes

This is a website with some of my favorite recipes. It consists of a main page in which all the recipes are listed, and then each recipe has a link that will lead you to the page where that recipe is.

In the recipe page, there's a photo of the recipe, a description, the ingredients, and also the instructions to make it.

With this project, I will enhance and practice my HTML skills and learn how to create a basic website skeleton, even if it's pretty basic.

Let's keep going! ( ദ്ദി ˙ᗜ˙ )
