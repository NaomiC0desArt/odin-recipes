        <p>These oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are super easy to mix up in a stand mixer or with your hand mixer. Simply cream together your butter (make sure it's soft for easy beating) and sugars. Then add the rest of the wet ingredients, then the rest of the dry ingredients.</p>
        <p>Luckily for you, these are drop cookies, so you don't even have to worry about working with the dough. Simply drop spoonfuls of dough onto ungreased baking sheets and bake them.</p>
