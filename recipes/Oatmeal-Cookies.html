        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are super easy to mix up in a stand mixer or with your hand mixer. Simply cream together your butter (make sure it's soft for easy beating) and sugars. Then add the rest of the wet ingredients, then the rest of the dry ingredients.</p>
        <p>Luckily for you, these are drop cookies, so you don't even have to worry about working with the dough. Simply drop spoonfuls of dough onto ungreased baking sheets and bake them.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups quick-cooking oats</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, until well combined; stir in vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Stir flour mixture into egg mixture until just blended. Mix in quick oats, walnuts, and chocolate chips. Drop batter by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
